# Effectiveness of European Regional Development Funds in reducing unemployment: a temporal analysis

This repository contains the code of the analysis carried out for my final thesis in the Master in Computational Social Sciences at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

The thesis analyzes the relationship between European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) spending—part of the EU’s Cohesion Policy—and regional unemployment across the EU from 2000 to 2022, with a focus on temporal changes. The analysis employs year-by-year cross-sectional regressions using four econometric models: absolute levels, annual growth rates, four-year growth rates, and an autoregressive model.
